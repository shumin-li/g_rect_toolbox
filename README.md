# g_rect_toolbox
A MATLAB toolbox for geo-rectification of oblique images.

This project is a modification of the [g_rect](https://srwebpolr01.uqar.ca/g_rect/index.php/A_Matlab_package_for_georectifying_oblique_digital_images_(g_rect)) toolbox to make it work better for rectifying drone images using the horizon, coastlines, and ship/drifter tracks as ground references.

The g_rect toolbox was created by 
- Daniel Bourgault - Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski (email: daniel_bourgault@uqar.ca)
- Rich Pawlowicz - University of British Columbia (email: rich@eos.ubc.ca)
- Clark Richards - Bedford Institute of Oceanography (email: Clark.Richards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)
