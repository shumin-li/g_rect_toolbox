% The image found in this folder ('IMG_6614.JPG') was taken from the ski resort
% Massif de Charlevoix in Quebec (Canada). It shows sea-ice in the St. Lawrence
% Estuary. This image is not associated with any publication and is provided here
% only as an example for the use of the g_rect package.

%% INPUT/OUTPUT INFORMATION
%    imgFname:      This is the only image that will actually be treated
%
%    firstImgFname: This is really just a comment not actually used by the algorithm 
%                   that indicates the name of the first image of a sequence to which 
%                   the georectification of image 'imgFname' could also be applied to.
%
%    lastImgFname:  Same as 'firstImgFname'but for the last sequential image.
%
%    outputFname:   This is the name of the output fil that will contain, among other 
%                   variables, the matrices LON and LAT that will give the ground 
%                   coordinate of every pixel of the image that are below the horizon.

%% FRAME OF REFERENCE
%    The frame of reference could be either 'Geodetic' or 'Cartesian'.
%    If 'Geodetic' is used, longitudes and latitudes are expected for positions.
%    If 'Cartesian' is used, x-y positions are expected (in m)
%
frameRef = 'Geodetic';

%% CAMERA POSITION 
%    Set the longitude and latitude for ‘Geodetic’ frame of reference 
%    Set the x-y coordinate for ‘Cartesian’ frame of reference 
%
LON0 = -70.6010167;                 
LAT0 =  47.2713000;                   

%% OFFSET
%    Offset from center of the principal point (generally zero)
%
ic = 0;
jc = 0;

%% CAMERA PARAMETERS
%    These are either the initial guesses for the uncertain parameters, i.e. those
%    with an uncertainty > 0 (see next section) or the exact values for the parameters
%    with an uncertainty set to 0 below.
%
%    hfov:   Field of view of the camera (degree)
%    lambda: Dip angle (degree) below horizontal (e.g. straight down = 90, horizontal = 0)
%    phi:    Tilt angle (degree), generally close to 0.
%    theta:  View angle (degree) clockwise from North (e.g. straight East = 90)
%    H:      Camera altitude relative to the local water level (m)
%
hfov   =  65;
lambda =   2;  
phi    =   0;  
theta  =  70; 
H      = 720;

%% UNCERTAINTIES 
%    Set here the uncertainties of the associated camera parameters. 
%    Set the uncertainty to 0 for fixed parameters.
%
dhfov   = 20;
dlambda = 10;
dphi    =  5;
dtheta  = 20;
dH      =  0;

%% POLYNOMIAL CORRECTION
%    After the geometrical correction, a polynomial correction of degree 1 or 2
%    could be applied. This could correct for some unknown distortions that cannot be
%    corrected on geometrical grounds. Play carefully with this option as it is a purely
%    mathematical fit which may lead to unphysical corrections or may hide other 
%    prior problems with the actual geometrical correction. Always first set this option 
%    to '0' in which case there will be no polynomial correction applied. In principle, 
%    the geometrical fit without this option should already be pretty good. You could then
%    fine tune the image with this option. Be extra careful when using the second order 
%    polynomial fit, especially outside the region of the GCPs as the image could there
%    be completely distorted.
%
polyOrder = 0;

%% PRECISION
%    To save memory, calculations can be done in single precision. 
%    For higher precision set the variable 'precision' to 'double';
%
precision = 'double';

%% GROUND CONTROL POINTS (GCPs). 
%    The GCP data must come right after the 'gcpData = true' instruction 
%    Column 1: horizontal image index of GCPs
%    Column 2: vertical image index of GCPs
%    Column 3: longitude (Geodetic) or x-position (Cartesian) of GCPs
%    Column 4: latitude (Geodetic) or y-position (Cartesian) of GCPs
%    Column 5: elevation (in m) of GCPs (optional)
