name: 'g_rect : a MATLAB package for georectifying oblique images'
description: |-
  This toolbox contains Matlab functions for georectifying highly oblique images. This is useful in oceanography for obtaining quantitative information on sea-surface patterns such as those induced by surface waves, internal waves, fronts, slicks, sea-ice, etc.

  The documentation of the g_rect package can be found here: https://srwebpolr01.uqar.ca/g_rect/
